"Snow fairies have haunted the highlands of Wesnoth for centuries, preferring "
"to stay in only the coldest and most inaccessible places. Unlike most elves, "
"they love the fragile beauty of the high mountain flowers and the soft multi-"
"colored palette of the heather, rather than the lush green forests preferred "
"by their lowland brethren. They even appreciate the delicate forms of the "
"underground mushrooms that are normally only seen by dwarves and trolls.\n"
"Snow fairies are powerful, ethereal, and elusive; even dwarvish wardens and "
"the highest-flying drakes rarely encounter them. They harness the elemental "
"power of the mountains to work their magic, suddenly animating the wiry "
"highland plants to entangle an unsuspecting target, or assailing their foes "
"with a magically-created cold flash of arctic purity."

"Elvanadíon began to grow ever more uneasy about Alingwen’s increasing "
"magical powers. He had always loathed the very idea of one of Baldres’ blood "
"living in his forest, and when Queen Melindë died of a serious illness, the "
"Duke soon convinced himself that it would be best to assign the girl’s "
"upbringing to a human tutor. The wizard Gulcyn, who had been instrumental in "
"rescuing Melindë from Baldres’ clutches, was persuaded to take on the "
"tuition of the young sorceress, in spite of the objections of his own wife, "
"Fioniel of the Misty Forest. At the age of eleven, Alingwen was forced to "
"leave the Greenwood, separating her from her own family."

"While Gulcyn’s kindness was beyond reproach, he was not very good with "
"children, and although he tried his best, managing the fey young princess "
"and his own magically-talented son was really beyond him. Tragedy was to "
"befall them; Gulcyn died in a magical accident, his son disappeared, mad "
"with grief and jealousy, and Alingwen found herself now sundered from her "
"foster family as well."

"Unfortunately, news of these sad tidings never reached the elves. Alingwen’s "
"half-sister Eämeral became queen of the Greenwood. Like her mother before "
"her, she preferred to stay in the southern castle at Elengavion, where she "
"was advised by the old hero Elen-Garil. Meanwhile her uncle, Lord Zluld, "
"ruled the elves of the northern Greenwood in her name. When Elen-Garil died "
"of old age, Lord Zluld moved south to assist the young queen in matters of "
"government."

"In Dorest, Dessen came to be called Elder Chief. He had governed the humans "
"continuously since the fall of Baron Baldres and his lieutenants, Ishlars "
"and Jil. Dessen usually stayed in the main keep within the city, and his "
"rulership brought the people of Dorest more freedom and tranquility than "
"they would ever have seen under Baldres. The continuing attacks by orcs gave "
"the Dorest humans and the Greenword elves a common enemy, and relations "
"between city and forest improved steadily over the years."

"Queen Eämeral continued to maintain the old Treaty of Dorest, signed long "
"ago by Chief Dessen, under which both sides agreed not to attack or invade "
"the other, and to provide mutual support in the face of orcish incursions. "
"As their mutual trust grew, humans and elves began to invite one another to "
"festivals and celebrations, then share the land, and eventually some even "
"had families together. When hordes of orcs attempted to retake Dorest, as "
"they did from time to time, they were driven back by the united forces of "
"humans and elves."

"On this day, a brave young elf, Háwclyn, son of the hero Elen-Garil, and "
"Zylvia, daughter of Lord Zluld, were patrolling the forest border between "
"Dorest and the southern Greenwood. This was a quiet area of the forest, "
"generally assigned to junior officers so they could gain command experience "

"threat was to come from a different, unexpected quarter."
