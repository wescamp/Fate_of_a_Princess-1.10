"Snow fairies have haunted the highlands of Wesnoth for centuries, preferring "
"to stay in only the coldest and most inaccessible places. Unlike most elves, "
"they love the fragile beauty of the high mountain flowers and the soft multi-"
"colored palette of the heather, rather than the lush green forests preferred "
"by their lowland brethren. They even appreciate the delicate forms of the "
"underground mushrooms that are normally only seen by dwarves and trolls.\n"
"Snow fairies are powerful, ethereal, and elusive; even dwarvish wardens and "
"the highest-flying drakes rarely encounter them. They harness the elemental "
"power of the mountains to work their magic, suddenly animating the wiry "
"highland plants to entangle an unsuspecting target, or assailing their foes "
"with a magically-created cold flash of arctic purity."
