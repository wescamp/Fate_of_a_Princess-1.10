            story= _ "Immediately after the fall of Baldres and the rescue of Queen Melindë, the elves withdrew to the Greenwood. But this was not the end of the conflict, for the elves changed their demands, now seeking for the surviving kidnapper, Jil, be delivered to them for punishment; while Jil lived, the war with the elves would continue. After a brief lull in the fighting – dictated by poor weather and flooding rather than any nobler reason – Elvanadíon sent Elen-Garil to attack the humans again. By this time, Jil had declared herself ‘Protector of Dorest’ and she had hand-picked a quick-witted new commander, Dessen, as her immediate subordinate. The two of them set out to meet this latest threat from the elves."
