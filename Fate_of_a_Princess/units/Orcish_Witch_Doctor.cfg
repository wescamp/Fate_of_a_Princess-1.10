    description= _ "A senior orcish shaman is known as a Witch Doctor. In combat, they can use a powerful magical curse that drains their foes’ life-force and uses it to heal the witch doctor. Witch doctors are still physically weak, but they have an aura of magical power around them that no orc could fail to notice. Stories abound of over-powerful warlords being brought low by the machinations of their shamans; but there are also tales of wise warlords who heeded their shamans’ advice and led their tribes to prosperity for decades at a time. Shamans and witch doctors, of course, are often also guardians of orcish tribal lore."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_DRAIN}
